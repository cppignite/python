This project will take the phone numbers and email addresses from a webpage or
document and store it in a string.

Tasks of the program:
  * Get text off the clipboard
    - We can do this with pyperclip
  * Find all phone numbers and email addresses in text
    - We can create two regexes, one for phone numbers and one for emails
    - We need to find all matches, not just one match
  * Paste them onto the clipboard
    - We need to format the strings into a single string
    - Display some message if no matches were found

Remember: Break apart a big project into smaller problems and do them all
          seperately. That makes the project managable in terms you already
          know
