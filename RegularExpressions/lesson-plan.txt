While you can search for text quickly with Ctrl+F, you must tell the computer
EXACTLY what you want to find.

Regular Expressions allow you to find a specific pattern of characters. This
is useful to know because many word processors allow the use of regular
expressions.

re module lets you compile Regex objects. You can use the Regex object to call
the methods: search() to find a single match, findall() to find all matching 
instances:, and sub() to do a find-and-replace substitution
