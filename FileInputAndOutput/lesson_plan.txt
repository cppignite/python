# Overview
Variables do not stay after your program is done. Files can help save data
after your program is finished. A file is just a large string.

# New Concepts
### File Paths and File Extensions
A file can be referred to in two ways, its filename and its path. The path is
the location of the file while the filename is the name of the file. For 
example, if I was the US President and I had the nuclear launch codes, the path
would probably be something like;

C:\Users\Trump\Documents\nuclear_launch_codes.txt

In this case, the filename of the launch codes is "nuclear_launch_codes.txt"
and the "Users", "Trump", and "Documents" are known as folders or directories.
the C:\ in Windows is called the root folder. Root means the base or the lowest 
you can go, like a plant. The root folder contains everything. In Linux or 
macOS, the root folder is /. Windows and Unix-based operating systems deal with
files different. Feel free to ask questions.

As a note, USB Drives are represented differently in Windows and Unix-based
operating systems. In Windows, USB Drives are shown with an entirely different
root folder like D:\ or E:\. In Linux and macOS, the drives are attached to 
the root folder, sometimes under mnt\.

### Backslash on Windows and Forward Slash on macOS and Linux
Another difference is that Windows paths are written with backslashes (\). As
macOS and Linux uses forward slashes (/). To make python work on all OS-es, you
will need to handle both cases, which will be shown further down.

A helpful function is **os.path.join()**, it will return a string with a file path
using the correct path seperators

```python
  >> import os
  >> path = os.path.join('usr', 'bin', 'spam')
  'usr\\bin\\spam' # on windoge
  'usr/bin/spam    # on best OS
```
You need double back slashes when using Windows because you need to use an 
escape character smh

### Current Working Directory (directory is another name for folder)
Follow along with the Python interactive shell. You may or may not get the same
output. Do not worry, we are more concerned with you trying out the functions
so you can see what they do.

**os.getcwd()** - gets current working directory
**os.chdir(path)** - changes the directory

```python
  >> import os
  >> os.getcwd()
  'C:\\Python34'
  >> os.chdir('C:\\Windows\\System32')
  >> os.getcwd()
  'C:\\Windows\\System32'
  >> os.chdir('C:\\RandomAFLocation')

  FileNotFoundError
```

### Absolute vs. Relative Paths
An absolute path is a path that starts from root. A relative starts from working
directory.

For example, C:\Users\Trump\Documents\nuclear_launch_codes.txt is the absolute 
path. While if I am in the Trump folder, .\Documents\nuclear_launch_codes.txt
is the relative path. We can try this out in the windows command line.

  . (dot) for this directory
  .. (dot-dot) for parent folder

### Creating New Folders
Use **os.makedirs(path)** to create a folder

## The os.path Module
Whenever we are working with paths, we will be using the os.path module. To 
import this, we only need to type in "import os". This module gives us a few 
additional functions that can help us. Try to follow along with the Python 
interactive shell

###  Handling Abssolute and Relative path
**os.path.abspath(path)** - returns a string with the absolute path of the
                          argument
```python
  >> os.path.abspath('.')
```
**os.path.isabs(path)** - returns True if argument is an absolute path
```python
  >> os.path.isabs('.') # Why is this sometimes false?
  False
  >> os.path.isabs(os.path.abspath('.')) # Why is this true?
  True
```
**os.path.relpath(path, start)** - returns a string of a relative path from
the start to path. If a start is not given, the current working directory
is used
```python
  >> os.path.relpath('C:\\Windows', 'C:\\')
  'Windows'
```

**os.path.dirname(path)** will return a string of everything that comes before
    the last slash
**os.path.basename(path)** will return a string of everything that comes after
    the last slash
```python
  >> path = 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe'
  >> os.path.basename(path)
  'calc.exe'
  >> os.path.dirname(path)
  'C:\\Windows\\System32'
```

**os.path.split(path)** takes a path and returns a tuple of the base + dirname
```python
  >> path = 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe'
  >> os.path.split(path)
  ('C:\\Windows\\System32', 'calc.exe')
``` 
# Finding File Sizes and Folder contents
**os.path.getsize(path)** returns the size in bytes of the file
**os.listdir(path)** returns a list of strings for each file in the path
```python
>> totalSize = 0
>> # What does this for-loop do?
>> for filename in os.listdir('.')
     totalSize = totalSize + os.path.getsize(os.path.join('.', filename))
>> print(totalSize) 
```
  
  os.path.abspath()
  os.path.basename()
  os.path.exists()
  file.startswith()
  file.endswith()
  open()
  write()
  os.path.join()
