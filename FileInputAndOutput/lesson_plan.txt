Variables do not stay after your program is done. Files can help save data
after your program is finished. A file is just a large string.

# File Paths and File Extensions
  Show Tree structure of a folder hierarchy
  What is the Root Folder?
  How are USB Drives seen differently in Windows and Linux?
    Windows show entirely different root folders
    Linux + OSX attach the drive to another folder in root

# Backslash on Windows and Forward Slash on OSX and Linux
  Windows paths are written with backslashes (\)
  OSX and Linux uses forward slashes (/)
  To make python work on all OS-es, you need to handle both cases
  os.path.join() does this easily with the correct path seperator

  >> import os
  >> path = os.path.join('usr', 'bin', 'spam')
  'usr\\bin\\spam' # on windoge
  'usr/bin/spam    # on best OS

  You need double back slashes because you need to use an escape character smh

# Current Working Directory (directory is another name for folder)

  >> import os
  >> os.getcwd()
  'C:\\Python34'
  >> os.chdir('C:\\Windows\\System32')
  >> os.getcwd()
  'C:\\Windows\\System32'
  >> os.chdir('C:\\RandomAFLocation')

  FileNotFoundError
