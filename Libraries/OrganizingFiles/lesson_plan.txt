#Overview
Earlier, we have learned how to create and write new files. Python also has the
has the ability to organize pre-existing files in your directory, adding to its
powerful scripting capabilities. For this project, we will tackle how to 
automatically back-up our files at will.

###Prior Setup
With working with files, it is important to know the extensions of a file
(.txt, .pdf, .doc, .jpg, etc.)

For computers running Windows, file extensions may be hidden. To show them, go
to Start -> Control Panel -> Appearance and Personalization -> Folder Options.
On the pop-up dialog, go to View -> Advanced Settings, and uncheck "Hide
extensions for known filetypes".

#New Concepts
### The shutil Module
The shutil, or shell utilities, module has functions that allow users to copy,
move, and delete files. We will need to import it with "import shutil"

###Copying files and Folders
shutil.copy(source, destination) will copy a file from the source to the 
destination. If destination path ends with a filename, the copied file will
have that name. If the destination path ends with a folder name, the copied 
file will be the same as the original. The function will return a string of
the path of the copied file.
shutil.copytree(source, destination) is similar to shutil.copy() but will also
copy folders.
