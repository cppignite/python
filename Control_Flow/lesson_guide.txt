Sometimes we do not want our program to go through every single line of code.
There are times we will want to make certain decisions based on what
information we get. 

 - Introduce abstraction w/ a flowchart as an example
 - How is it represented in Python?

** Overview

# Boolean Values
  - Only two values, True or False
    + Must be capitalized, true or false will give error
  - Comparison Operators ( ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
    + Shannon already wrote these out in lesson 1, either move or copy
    + Special case, 42 == '42' will return false. but 42 == 42.0 is true
    + EMPHASIZE difference between = and ==
# Boolean Operators
  - Binary operators ( and, or, not)
    + talk about truth tables
# Conditions
  - Mixing Boolean and and Comparison Operators
    + We can do this because Comparison Operators evaluate to a boolean value
    + Talk about Short-Circuiting
    + Order of Operations
# Flow of Control
  - What are Conditions? -Boolean values
    + also, empty strings '' and int 0 counts as "False"
  - Blocks of Code, Talk about indentation
  - Control Statements
    + if Statement
      ~ All control flow statements end in a colon and are followed by a new block
    + else Statement
    + elif 
      ~ Order of elif matters
      e.g. elif age > 12
           elif age > 100
           # if age = 101, does the second elif run?
    + while Loops
    + break Statements
      ~ continue statement
  - Infinite Loops
    + Ctrl+C to stop the program
  - For Loops
    + How while loops and for loops are the same
    + range() function
      ~ talk about the 2 and 3 argument variants of range()
    + for i in range(5):
    + i is set to 0
# Import
  - sys.exit() to leave program
