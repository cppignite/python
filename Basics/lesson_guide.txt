* What is Programming?
  - Is programming something mysterious like a hacker typing 1s and 0s on the
      screen like on tv?
  - Programming is just entering instructions for a computer 
  - Some common instructions:
    ~ "Do this; then do that"
    ~ "If this condition is true, perform this action; otherwise, do that action."
    ~ "Do this action this many times"
    ~ "Keep doing this action until I say otherwise"
  - Give example of Python code and see if they can read it as an exercise
    ~ They are supposed to guess, not supposed to know 
  - What is python?
  - Do programmers need to know a lot of math?
    ~ No, other than Pre-Algebra.
    ~ Do you need math to solve Sudoku puzzles or logic? Same idea.
      Using numbers != math
      # maybe give a sudoku puzzle example just as a fun break
  - Is programming boring? No, it's more creative like legos.
    ~ You have the basic idea of a castle and you have your available blocks.
      Then you start building. Once you are done, you can make your code pretty 
    ~ Parallels to app inventor
    ~ With programming, you don't need to buy extra blocks. All "abstract".
   *~ Mistakes and bugs are not bad. Just another skill to fix. Nobody cares
      about fuck ups. They happen often. This isn't a test or you won't lose
      material / money.
* How to install python?
  - We can do this if the students have their own laptops. If not, we will
    point them to the wiki.
* How to find help?
  - Talk about error messages
  - Do an exercise on error messages. Google search error. Programmers ask so
    many questions, yours probably already has an answer. Nobody knows the 
    answer to everything.
  - Give tips on how to ask for help

** Python Basics - There's a lot to know about Python. Luckily, you don't need
                   to know much in order to start making programs.
  - You will need to start learning programming concepts like in App Inventor
# Expressions
 - e.g 2 + 2  gives 4
 - Let's give a list of operatiors. 
   ~ ** - Exponent
   ~ %  - Modulus
   ~ // - Integer Division
   ~ /  - Division
   ~ *  - Multiplication
   ~ -  - Subtraction
   ~ +  - Addition
# Data types - Integer, Floating-Point, String
# String Concatenation and Replication
# Storing Values in variables
  * Use a picture of a box as a variable and the data as the items we store
    - talk about meaningful varaible names

** Remember to talk about error messages throughout
